Displaying of Gbox and letter within is done by "test.html" file(associated js file "test_1.js")
    Number of rows also displayed in the above mentioned HTML file

Gboxes along with corresponding data from the json file is displayed by opening "sample.html" file
(associated js file "sample.js")

In all the displays the position of letter displayed is varied in range, x-coordinate(30 - 150),
y-coordinate(60-300). This scaling corresponding to letter's x and y coordinate in Gbox data
according to mathematical function mentioned in updatex.txt file.
If not for scaling, some letter's were not seen inside the bounding boxes.
Large bounding boxes drawn, led to slowing down the system.
